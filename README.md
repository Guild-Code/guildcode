## Editing and DeBugging:

>Files and code management to be done on GitHub and git/gh-cli. Use a text editor of your choice

1. Create a new branch, give it a resonable name that indicates your identity and activity.
2. Create a new issue based on what your doing, (Do this only if there are no particular issue assigned to you as a role)
3. After completing your code, create a pull request and wait for the tests to run. Once the tests are done wait for approval from the project manager/CTO to approve the PR, who will later merge the updated to the main branch on production.
4. Do not alter the files that define the development or environment or configuration without consultations. (Only allowed when updating dependecies)
